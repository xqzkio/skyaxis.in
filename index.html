    <div class="box8 ajustify">
      SkyAxis was started by a team of like-minded trainers, who wanted to
      empower fellow human beings by facilitating skill and talent development.
      At a time when most knowledge is available on hand-held devices,
      in various formats such as text, imagery and even video, 
      the objective of an educator simply becomes facilitation, or 
      bringing about the learning process by "teaching how and what to learn".
      <br><br>
      At SkyAxis, we design and facilitate effective
      training sessions and courses to help trainees hone their skills and 
      unlock their potential.
